            <p>Yes, it really costs $9,000</p>

            <p>Acer now has the most expensive gaming laptop on the market. The Predator 21 X, which was first shown off at IFA 2016 in September, will be available in February for a ludicrous $8,999, making it a whole $4,000 more expensive than the most expensive gaming notebook available through Newegg. Europeans will have to fork out â‚¬9,999 for this beast.<br>
            <br>So what does nine thousand dollars of gaming laptop actually get you? Top of the line hardware across the board, including a 21-inch curved ultrawide display with a 2560 x 1080 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate. Acer is proudly calling this the first laptop with a curved display, although at 8kg heavy it won't exactly be a portable machine.<br></p><br>

            <p>The Predator 21 X is kitted out with a brand new overclockable Intel 'Kaby Lake' Core i7-7820HK processor, and two Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs in SLI, each with 8 GB of GDDR5X memory. There's also 64GB of DDR4-2400 memory, and up to four 512GB SSDs including two on an NVMe PCIe bus. Acer will even chuck in a 1TB hard drive and Killer DoubleShot Pro networking.<br>
            <br>Acer has managed to fit in a full-sized mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown keyswitches because this laptop is so large. Each key has programmable RGB LED backlighting, and the numpad on the right-hand side flips over to create a trackpad. Tobii eye tracking with Windows Hello support is included, as is a six-speaker audio system.<br>
            <br>At such an exorbitant price, it's unlikely that Acer will sell a significant amount of Predator 21 Xs. But if you're interested in owning the most expensive gaming laptop, it'll hit stores in February.<br></p><br><br>
