            <p>The vivo X100 and X100 Pro unveiled last month and currently exclusive to China will launch globally next week, on December 14.<br>
            <br>This revelation comes from vivo through its global website, where it set up an event page for the X100 and X100 Pro. It reveals that both smartphones have been on pre-order since November 24, and their launch event will begin at 7PM next Thursday. vivo didn't mention the time zone, though.<br></p><br>

            <p>The vivo X100 and X100 Pro are powered by the Dimensity 9300 SoC, and the most notable difference between them is in the camera and battery departments. The X100 packs a 5,000 mAh battery with 120W wired charging, while the X100 Pro has a 5,400 mAh cell under the hood with 100W wired and 50W wireless charging.<br>
            <br>Both smartphones sport a triple camera setup on the rear, with the 50MP ultrawide unit common between the two since the primary and periscope telephoto cameras are different. The X100 comes with a 50MP 1/1.49" primary camera and 64MP 70mm periscope telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom, while the X100 Pro features a 50MP 1/0.98" primary camera and a 50MP 100mm periscope telephoto unit with 4.3x optical zoom.</p><br>
