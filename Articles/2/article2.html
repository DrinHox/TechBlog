            <p>2023 is coming to a close, and almost all the major phone launches of the year have now taken place.<br>
                But hundreds of new handsets have been released since January, so how do you actually decide which is best for you?<br>
                That’s where this article comes in. We’ve reviewed and ranked loads of phones, but only the 10 absolute finest have made the grade for inclusion here. Whether performance, cameras, design or simply value for money are your top priority, there’s a phone here for you.<br>
                And it’s a diverse list, with phones from the likes of Google, Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola and Xiaomi all included. Nothing, Nokia, Realme, Asus and Oppo aren’t represented here, but you will find them in some of our other smartphone round-ups – including the best budget phones and best mid-range phones.<br>
                But if money is no object, you’ve come to the right place. Here are the 10 best phones you can buy right now.<br></p><br>

            <h2><strong> Google Pixel 8 Pro – Best phone for most people</strong></h2>
            <img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Google-Pixel-8-Pro_review_2-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro image">
            <p>The Pixel 7 Pro was already an excellent smartphone, but the Pixel 8 Pro takes things to the next level.<br>
                Not only does the Tensor G3 chip boost performance, it enables a range of genuinely useful software features. Many of these improve the photography experience, where Google’s advanced processing and capable lenses deliver consistently excellent photos.<br>
                Android 14 on the Pixel is the cleanest and most intuitive software on any smartphone, and it’ll now be supported by Google for an incredible seven years. Add in a luxurious, premium build and price that still undercuts the top-tier flagships, and the Pixel 8 Pro is a superb smartphone.<br>
                However, it’s not all good news. The battery life and charging could still do with improvement, while the big, heavy design won’t suit everyone..<br>
                If the latter is an issue for you, the regular Pixel 8 is a better bet. But there are a few other differences between them.<br></p>

            <h2><strong>iPhone 15 Pro – Best iPhone</strong></h2>
            <img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review_5.jpg?quality=50&strip=all" alt="iPhone 15 Pro image">
            <p>The iPhone 15 Pro has a collection of small changes that, when combined, represent a significant upgrade.<br>
                A new titanium build is durable but noticeable lighter, and there’s also a new customisable Action Button to replace the mute switch. Apple’s A17 Pro chipset is the most capable on any smartphone, and delivers truly stellar performance, while the introduction of USB-C is undoubtedly a step forward.<br>
                The 6.1in display is relatively compact by modern phone standards, but it looks excellent and benefits from the 120Hz refresh rate. Battery life is generally solid, though you’ll still have to put up with slow charging speeds.<br>
                But despite the missing 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, the all-round camera experience is superb. Many apps now support the genuinely useful Dynamic Island, and iOS 16 is just as slick and intuitive as ever.<br>
                For most people, the iPhone 15 Pro is the sweet spot in Apple’s 2023 smartphone range.<br></p>

            <h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra – The phone with everything</strong></h2>
            <img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra_review_2.jpg?quality=50&strip=all" alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra  image">
            <p>If you want the phone on the market with the most features possible, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is it. It’s a big, expensive phone but you get every possible feature you could want in a smartphone in 2023 with incredibly good triple cameras, very good battery life that lasts well over a day, performance as fast as any rival phone, and of course, the now-unique S-Pen stylus tucked away in the phone for when you need it.<br>
                It’s one of few phones out there with a squared off body and screen, but it feels good to hold thanks to top build quality and nicely tapered edges and screen. This design rewards you with the best screen of any phone, perfect for any app you can throw at it, and superlative for watching videos..<br>
                The 200Mp main camera is outstanding, particularly if you like slightly saturated colours that pop more than they do in real life. That’s not to say they look artificial though – the quality is superb with the versatility of an ultrawide and two separate 3x and 10 optical telephoto lenses that are all excellent. It;s a shame the selife camera is terrible in low light..<br>
                <P>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
            
            <h2><strong>OnePlus 11 – Best value flagship phone</strong></h2>
            <img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OnePlus-11_review_1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all" alt="OnePlus11 image">
            <p>OnePlus has nailed the balance with the OnePlus 11, bringing a fully-featured premium smartphone for an outstanding price. At $699/£729/€849, the only things it noticeably misses out on are wireless charging and full waterproofing (we are more annoyed about the latter than the former).<br>
                If you can forgo those nice-to-haves then you’ll find yourself with a phone that has everything else you could want: amazingly fast performance, an excellent display, strong cameras including a very good main 50Mp lens, and four years of Android updates and five of security updates. That’s only matched in the Android world by Samsung and Fairphone (iPhones get the longest software support at more than five years).<br>
                The OnePlus 11 is also a slim and svelte phone despite its 6.7in screen, which isn’t the case with other huge phones. You can go for the green glossy model or the black version that has a matt, almost-silk like finish to the back glass. It means it gets zero fingerprints, but it’s one of the slipperiest phones out there.<br>
                So long as you don’t mind the slight laboured newer version of OxygenOS that often changes Android for change sake, then this is a great phone at a price that ensures you’ll get your money’s worth if you can make it last five years.<br>
                If you’re looking for a foldable, consider the OnePlus Open.<br></p>
