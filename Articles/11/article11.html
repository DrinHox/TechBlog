            <p>More than 60 days into the Israel-Gaza war, two Israeli news outlets – +972 magazine and Local Call – published a report on The Gospel, a new artificial intelligence system deployed in Gaza.<br>
            <br>The AI helps generate new targets at an unprecedented rate, allowing the Israeli military to loosen its already permissive constraints on the killing of civilians.<br></p><br><br>
    
            <p><strong>Video Transcript:</strong><br>Eight weeks now into the war on Gaza we're looking at multiple angles of this story and the way it's been covered, starting with Artificial Intelegence as an Israeli weapon of War and the real life and death consequences for Palesitians.<br>
            <br>Israeli hostages released by Hamas are telling stories that are proving very inconvinient for the Israeli government.<br>
            <br>And the West Bank, what should be a safer space, is racked with violence and constant Israeli Surveilance.<br><br>
            <br>More than two months of Isralei bombing have turned the Gaza Strip into a hellscape, entire neighborhoods have been wiped out, made uninhabitable with. More than 16'000 Palestinans killed, it is a population on the run, an unfolding gencide and we now know that the unprecedented killing of Gazans is being powered by at least in part by <strong>AI</strong>, an <strong>Israeli Artifical Intelegence System</strong> that generates new targets at a rate which we have never seen before. One former Israeli intellegence officer likens the AI system to a mass assassination Factory. Reports about that technology have now been published by two Israeli news outlets: 972 and Local Call.<br>
            <br> For years the Israeli military has been milinkg the country's Tech Sector to find more and more ways of managing its occupation of Palestinians, and AI is just the latest high tech weapon in what has turned into a barbaris Israeli War on Gaza, one bombing after another, the mass killing and displacement of Palestinian civillans.<br></p><br>
